# Drag-Model Port — Migration Log: Tier 2

**Purpose.** This log is the **decision + delivery history for Tier 2** (generative
mass dynamics + size-distribution comparison). Tier-0 history lives in
`docs/drag_port/Tier0/drag_migration_log_tier0.md`; Tier-1a history in
`docs/drag_port/Tier1/drag_migration_log_tier1a.md`.

**Companion docs:** `TIER2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (the active build plan),
`DRAG_PORT_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` (frozen design),
`MASS_DYNAMICS_LOCKED_energy_gated_evaporation.md` (the live mass-model detail),
`CALIBRATION_MAP.md` (parameter classes + Tier anchors).

## Tier-2 planning — decision record (2026-06-29)

Study of `CLAUDE.md`, `DRAG_PORT_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`,
`MASS_DYNAMICS_LOCKED_energy_gated_evaporation.md`, `CALIBRATION_MAP.md`, and the
Tier-1a plan/log, plus a code-surface audit. No code written (the
`[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]` boundary holds); these are documentation + scoping
decisions for the eventual build.

- **Tier-2 broken into 11 slices across 6 phases** (`TIER2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`):
  Phase A energetics primitives (L ladder, K cooling, U E_int budget); Phase B
  stochastic channels (ρ density, P pickup, Q evaporation); Phase C schema +
  generative integrator (X v6→v7 + 5-term invariant, G generative driver); Phase D
  bridge (Z generative-vs-anchored); Phase E observable (H extraction, W Wasserstein,
  D2 diagnostics); Phase F campaign (R2). The 5-term invariant is the cross-cutting
  correctness gate from X onward.

- **Three scope decisions (user, 2026-06-29):** (1) **full program** —
  mechanism + comparison + calibration; (2) **validation-first** — first generative
  runs at the 0.80 eV (d=9 Å) budget cross-checked against the TDDFT 21→19→14 decline
  and the Tier-1a anchored results, then the 2.70 eV production onset; (3) **include
  the generative-vs-anchored bridge slice** (Z) to de-risk the mechanism before the
  experimental histogram.

- **Tier-2 reference data confirmed present** (no export slice needed):
  `data/reference/integrated_i_he_abundance.csv` (experimental I⁺Heₙ size
  distribution, the arbiter), `data/reference/vmi_summary/vmi_iplus_*.csv`
  (per-fragment velocities), `data/reference/9A_All_Data.csv` (TDDFT cross-check).

- **Reuse confirmed from Tier 1a:** `physics/mass_jump.py` resets, `physics/baoab.py`
  SQ1 O-step, the `shed_step` jump-then-O seam, the v6 checkpoint + v5 shim, the
  4-term `ion_ledger_closure`, `velocity_distribution.py`, and `tier1a_common`/
  `gen_tier1a_runs` orchestration. Tier 2 makes sheds generative (adds pickup + RRK
  evaporation + E_int reservoir + cooling), extends to the 5-term invariant, and adds
  the size-distribution comparison layer.

- **Naming item flagged for build:** MASS §11 names the production value
  `biphasic_energy_gated`; `config.py` currently has `biphasic`. Recommend keeping
  `biphasic` and aliasing in docs; resolve at the Phase-C build.

- **Open: OQ1 (drag electronic-state provenance)** stays open → carry both electronic
  pictures as the co-fit free knob; do not cite E_bind as independent support for the
  mixture. User is in author contact; update on resolution.

## Phase A detailed plan — delivered (2026-06-29)

The rough Phase A sketch in `TIER2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §4 was expanded into a
dedicated, Tier-1a-depth plan: **`TIER2_PHASE_A_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**. No code
(the `[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]` boundary holds); planning doc only.

- **Module layout decided (user, 2026-06-29):** three separate one-concern pure
  modules — `physics/dissociation_ladder.py` (L), `physics/internal_energy_cooling.py`
  (K), `physics/internal_energy_budget.py` (U) — mirroring the Tier-1a
  `shell_schedule.py` / `mass_jump.py` precedent and the L/K/U independence in the
  dependency graph. New sourced constants land in `constants.py`; new knobs in
  `config.py`.
- **Content:** per-slice interface contracts, LaTeX-with-dimensional-checks encoded
  forms (Form U ladder + gate; Newton cooling + occupancy-resolved `E_∞(N)` +
  pair/electrostriction split; S1/S2/K1 ΔE_int rules + post-t× reconstruction), a
  consolidated golden-oracle fixture table, the config field map (MASS §11 names),
  intra-phase build order (L → K → U with mocks), test methodology, and the
  out-of-scope guard (no RNG / integrator / E_int state / 5-term closure / noise —
  those are Phase B/C/Tier 3).
- **Golden values verified by direct conversion:** `D_0(1)` 106.9 cm⁻¹ = 0.013254 eV
  (X₂) / 74.4 cm⁻¹ = 0.009224 eV (mix); `D_floor` 4.97 cm⁻¹; `Σ(21)` X₂ 0.25–0.28 eV /
  mix 0.17–0.19 eV; `|S|/n*` = 118 cm⁻¹ @ n*=21; f_int floor @ 0.80 eV X₂ 0.31–0.35 /
  mix 0.21–0.24, @ 2.70 eV X₂ 0.09–0.10 / mix ~0.065.

## Phase B detailed plan — delivered (2026-06-29)

The rough Phase B sketch in `TIER2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §4 (the two stochastic
channels) was expanded into a dedicated, Tier-1a/Phase-A-depth plan:
**`TIER2_PHASE_B_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**. No code (the `[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]`
boundary holds); planning doc only.

- **Two design decisions locked (user, 2026-06-29):**
  1. **Module layout — three one-concern modules + capture in `mass_jump.py`:**
     `physics/helium_density.py` (ρ), `physics/pickup.py` (P), `physics/evaporation.py`
     (Q); the +He **capture reset** extends `physics/mass_jump.py` symmetric to
     `cold_shed`/`continuous_velocity_shed`, keeping the reduced-mass defect formula in
     one place. Mirrors the Phase-A 3-module split and the ρ/P/Q dependency-graph
     independence.
  2. **ρ sourcing — reuse the erf-complement gate:** Slice ρ uses the same
     `0.5·(1−erf(depth/steepness))` form as `drag.py::spatial_gate` (steepness 14.2 Å) as
     the `ρ_He/ρ_bulk` ratio; a **sourced baseline/TDDFT density profile is the declared
     fallback** (rule-2 convention), not built in Phase B. The drag spatial gate stays
     **G2** (no G2→G4 promotion this phase; CALIBRATION_MAP rows 5/8).
- **Content:** per-slice interface contracts (ρ/P/Q + the `mass_jump.capture`
  counterpart), LaTeX-with-dimensional-checks for the density gate, pickup
  (`P_attach`, `λ_attach` with Langmuir cap, momentum-conserving capture reset + defect,
  S1 heat) and evaporation (self-bound gate, saturating RRK rate with `n=1` direct
  dissociation, cold-shed reuse, K1 drain), the consolidated golden-oracle fixture table,
  the config field map (MASS §11 names + the `mass_rate_*`→`pickup_*` rename flagged as a
  build-time item), the intra-phase build order (ρ → {P, Q}, P/Q parallelizable), the
  seeded/mock-RNG test methodology, and the out-of-scope guard (no integrator / O-step /
  `E_int` state / schema bump / 5-term closure / noise / drag-law / fitting — those are
  Phase C / Phase F / Tier 3).
- **Reuse confirmed:** `mass_jump.py` reset spine (`cold_shed`,
  `_reduced_mass_defect_coeff`, `kick_factor`, component variants),
  `drag.py::spatial_gate` (the erf-complement gate, shared via a single helper),
  Phase-A L/U primitives (mocked at unit level), and `config.py` `check_drag_config`
  validator scaffolding. New physics is only the `mass_jump.capture` counterpart and the
  two channel modules.

---

## Phase C detailed plan — delivered (2026-06-29)

The rough Phase C sketch in `TIER2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §4 (Slice X schema + 5-term
invariant; Slice G generative driver) was expanded into a dedicated, Phase-A/B-depth
plan: **`TIER2_PHASE_C_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**. No code (the
`[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]` boundary holds); planning doc only.

- **Two design decisions locked (user, 2026-06-29):**
  1. **Slice G placement — extend `simulation/ion_propagation_step.py`** with a
     `biphasic_step` seam alongside `shed_step` / `baoab_propagation_step`, reusing the
     `IonStepState` dataclass (extended with `E_int_eV`) and the SQ1 O-step in place.
     Mirrors the Tier-1a `shed_step` precedent.
  2. **Production scenario name — keep `biphasic`.** The `MassScenario` literal stays
     `{fixed, biphasic, anchored_discrete}`; `biphasic` *is* the production value (full
     name `biphasic_energy_gated`, MASS §11, documentation only). No config-enum rename,
     no §6.5 guard-set churn.
- **Content:** the two slices with full interface contracts —
  **X** (checkpoint **v6→v7** adding `E_int_eV (2N,T)` + a v6→v7 back-compat shim
  mirroring the delivered v5→v6 shim; `IonStepState.E_int_eV` field; the **5-term
  invariant** `E_kin+E_pot+E_dissip+E_mass_transfer+E_int≈const` extended *in place* in
  `energy_balance.ion_energy_totals`/`ion_ledger_closure`; the **RNG draw-order lock**),
  and **G** (the `biphasic_step` per-step loop: conservative kicks → K2 cooling → at most
  one mass event, shed-then-pickup if both → jump-then-O with the SQ1 O-step rebuilt at
  `m⁺` → S1/S2/K1/K2 `E_int` update). Plus the §6 per-channel closure table, the
  reduced-mass capture defect, the R4 double-count guard, the config contract (integrator
  flags + the §6.5 `time_resolved`/`allow_inconsistent_mass_pairing` path), build order
  (X before G), analytic-limit test methodology, and the out-of-scope guard (no new
  channel physics / noise / drag-law change / draw-order change / D-E-F steps).
- **Reuse confirmed (code audited):** `checkpoint.py` v6 + the v5→v6
  `_migrate_ion_checkpoint` shim + `_validate_against_cfg` `trajectory_2N_T_fields`;
  `energy_balance.py` `ion_energy_totals` / `ion_ledger_closure` (the 4-term gate, with
  `E_mass_transfer` already added as an optional term — the pattern X follows for
  `E_int`); `ion_propagation_step.py` `IonStepState`, the `shed_step` SQ2/SQ3 seam, and
  `baoab_propagation_step`; `physics/baoab.py` SQ1 O-step; the §6.5 guard
  (`_EVOLVING_MASS_SCENARIOS` → `time_resolved` requirement → `allow_inconsistent_mass_
  pairing` override). G adds **no new physics** — it composes accepted A/B modules + the
  Tier-1a seam.
- **Schema version reconcile noted:** MASS §7 text says "v6" (predates the Tier-1a v6 use
  of the slot); the live schema is already v6, so Tier 2 bumps **v6→v7** for `E_int_eV` —
  the v6→v7 shim is the reconcile, recorded so the doc/code version story stays straight.

---

## Phase D detailed plan — delivered (2026-06-29)

The rough Phase D sketch in `TIER2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §4 (Slice Z, the
generative-vs-anchored bridge) was discussed and expanded into a dedicated plan:
**`TIER2_PHASE_D_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**. No code (the `[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]`
boundary holds); planning doc only. Brainstormed live with the user before writing.

- **Three design decisions locked (user, 2026-06-29):**
  1. **Minimalistic existence demonstration** — Slice Z runs a **single representative
     priored parameter point** (λ₀, f_int, f_ret, τ chosen in-band, *not* fitted) to show a
     priored point *exists* that reproduces the 9 Å kinematics. **Not** a sweep, **not** a
     mean-field ODE layer, **not** a calibration (those stay in Phase F).
  2. **Minimal reconstruction self-contained in D** — the bridge builds only the thin
     pieces it needs (mean `n(t)` = average of the v7 `n_shell` array over the run's ions;
     tiny `t×` = first `E_int<Σ(n)` and `Π(t)=λ·f_ret·τ` helpers; reuse
     `compare_distance`/`compare_velocity_magnitude` for `R(t)`/`|v(t)|`). **Phase-E
     Slices H/W/D2 are NOT pulled forward.**
  3. **Targets loaded, not regenerated** — read the delivered Tier-1a anchored `n(t)`
     artifact + the frozen 9 Å TDDFT curve (`data/reference/9A_All_Data.csv`) as fixed
     comparison targets (no anchored-artifact churn). **Ensemble = the ions in one
     generative run** (no multi-run seeding).
- **Nature:** Phase D builds **no new physics and no new modules** — it is a **run +
  compare + report** slice composing the delivered Phase-C `biphasic` driver, the Tier-1a
  `tier1a_common`/`gen_tier1a_runs` scaffolding, the `compare_*` helpers, and the 5-term
  `ion_ledger_closure`, plus two tiny `t×`/`Π` reconstruction helpers (placed where
  Phase-E D2 later generalizes them).
- **Content:** the run (9 Å / 0.80 eV `biphasic`, scenario-stamped → §6.5 pairing guard →
  `allow_inconsistent_mass_pairing=True`), the loaded kinematic targets (anchored
  21→19→14 staircase, 9 Å TDDFT `R(t)`/`|v(t)|`, GAH25 `t×` 5–6.5 ps ±factor-2 prior, Π
  regime), the two reconstruction helpers + their unit tests, the few-step driver smoke
  (5-term invariant), and the **written diagnostic report** with the actionable-lever
  framing for any miss. **Reported, not auto-adjudicated** (mirrors the Tier-1a reporting
  stance; the bridge *localizes* a bug, it does not arbitrate fidelity — experiment does
  that at Phase E/F).

---

## Phase E detailed plan — delivered (2026-06-29)

The rough Phase E sketch in `TIER2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §4 (Slices H/W/D2 — the
Tier-2 observable / comparison layer) was expanded into a dedicated, Phase-A/B/C/D-depth
plan: **`PHASE_E_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**. No code (the `[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]`
boundary holds); planning doc only.

- **Three scope decisions locked (user, 2026-06-29):**
  1. **R5 truncation → build a post-ejection relaxation stage.** Terminal `n` at 20 ps is
     only an upper bound (MASS §R5); Phase E adds a **reduced relaxation driver** (Slice E2,
     `simulation/relaxation_stage.py`) that propagates the energy-gated cascade forward to
     the experimental timescale with **pickup and drag off** (the locked Q/K/U channels in
     their free-flight, evaporation-only limit — no new physics), so the size distribution
     is read at matched time.
  2. **Size distribution only.** The `vmi_summary/*.csv` references are **aggregate**
     I⁺He / I⁺-gas distributions, not per-fragment per-`n`; Phase E **drops velocity
     comparison entirely** and commits to the integer-n size distribution
     (`integrated_i_he_abundance.csv`) as the sole observable. The original Slice-H
     per-fragment velocity histograms are **cut**.
  3. **Pure functions only.** No CLI / figure / report scripts; all orchestration and
     figures deferred to the Phase F campaign (R2).
- **Re-slice H/W/D2 → E1–E5:** **E1** terminal integer-n size-distribution extractor
  (`postprocess/size_distribution.py`); **E2** relaxation stage (above); **E3** abundance
  reference loader mirroring `hedft_loader` (`postprocess/abundance_loader.py`); **E4**
  pure-numpy integer-support Wasserstein `W₁=Σ|F_sim−F_ref|`
  (`postprocess/distribution_compare.py`, activates `validation_histogram_metric`);
  **E5** derived diagnostics `t×`/`Π(t)`/regime/total-strip reachability
  (`postprocess/derived_diagnostics.py`).
- **Hard prerequisites:** Slice X (v7 `E_int_eV`) gates E2/E5; L+P+K gate E5; G+Q+K+U gate
  E2. E1/E3/E4 are buildable now on synthetic v7 checkpoints. Real runs are wired in at
  Phase F (R2) — Phase E is tested entirely on synthetic checkpoints + the real CSV.
- **Reuse confirmed (code audited):** `shell_schedule.complex_mass_amu` (E1 rung labels),
  `RunDirectory`/`IonCheckpoint.n_shell`/`mass_final_kg` (E1), the Slice-G `biphasic_step`
  loop + `shed_step` seam + `mass_jump.cold_shed` (E2, pickup/drag disabled),
  `hedft_loader.load_hedft_trajectory` contract (E3 mirror),
  `config.validation_histogram_metric` (E4), `energy_balance.ion_ledger_closure` 5-term
  (E2/E5 invariant context). New physics is **none** — E2 only composes accepted channels.
- **Cross-cutting gates:** the 5-term invariant is E2's correctness detector (pickup off,
  drag frozen → `E_dissip` constant); integer-n support + pure-numpy Wasserstein
  throughout; the R5 matched-time/upper-bound caveat is carried in every E4 record; the
  locked RNG draw order is *extended* (shed-only) for the relaxation stage, default
  `relaxation_stage_enabled=False` so default scope is unchanged.

---

## Phase F detailed plan — delivered (2026-06-29)

The rough Phase F sketch in `TIER2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §4 (Slice R2 — the
calibration campaign + production switch) was expanded into a dedicated plan:
**`PHASE_F_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**. No code (the `[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]`
boundary holds); planning doc only. Phase F is the stage that **absorbs everything
the earlier phases postponed** — the κ+picture co-fit, the f_int/f_ret/τ bounded
scalars, the 0.80→2.70 eV production switch, identifiability + regime reporting, the
Calvo24 total-strip runs, and all CLI/scoreboard/figure scripts Phase E deferred.

- **Three scope decisions locked (user, 2026-06-29):**
  1. **Staged (clean-fallback) calibration** (MASS §6.11): co-fit only the two Free
     knobs (κ + electronic picture); pin `f_int` at a fixed `τ`; then a
     `τ`-insensitivity sweep; `f_ret` via the 9/18 Å density contrast. The full
     κ×picture×f_int×f_ret×τ grid is a **documented escalation** only.
  2. **Larger-N, single-seed runs** (N≈500 → ~1000 fragments/run) for a stable
     size-distribution histogram / Wasserstein score.
  3. **Build the total-strip secondary-run path now**; **R6** 9-Å re-extraction and
     the **p↔κ** cap split stay **documented conditional triggers** (built on demand).
- **Re-slice R2 → F1–F6:** **F1** campaign harness (`scripts/tier2_common.py`,
  `build_biphasic_cfg` + run-dir convention mirroring `tier1a_common`); **F2** staged
  run-matrix generator (`scripts/gen_tier2_runs.py`, 0.80 eV first, 9 Å + 18 Å,
  ion→relaxation pipeline); **F3** scoreboard
  (`scripts/post_processing/tier2_size_distribution_table.py`, composes E1/E2/E4/E5 →
  per-run W₁ matched + upper-bound + diagnostics, mirrors `tier1a_rmse_table.py`);
  **F4** identifiability + regime report (`tier2_identifiability_report.py`); **F5**
  2.70 eV production switch (gated on 0.80 eV landing) + total-strip secondary runs;
  **F6** overlay figures (`SHOW_FIGURE`-gated).
- **Nature:** Phase F builds **no new physics and no new `SimConfig` physics fields**
  — it composes only **accepted A–E modules** + the Phase-D bridge gate, and only
  calibration *values* move via config knobs. New surfaces are orchestration scripts +
  report assemblers + figures (plus a `total_strip` run-tag variant).
- **Reuse confirmed (code audited):** `tier1a_common.build_anchored_cfg` /
  `tier1a_run_tag` / `tier1a_run_dir_name` (F1 mirror), `tier0_common.build_drag_cfg` /
  `run_dir_name`, `complex_mass_amu(21)`; `gen_tier1a_runs._run_one` neutral→ion
  pipeline (F2); `tier1a_rmse_table` `collect_*`/`score_*`/`format_table`/
  `write_rows_csv` + figure-builder pattern (F3/F6); E1–E5 + `load_he_abundance_
  reference` + 5-term `ion_ledger_closure` (F3/F4).
- **Cross-cutting gates:** validation-first (0.80 eV, Phase-D-bridge-cross-checked,
  before the 2.70 eV switch); **reported, not auto-adjudicated** (no code asserts a
  fidelity verdict); scenario-stamped `coulomb_available_eV` guards the budget↔drag
  pairing with `allow_inconsistent_mass_pairing=True` the normal production path (R6,
  §6.6); 5-term invariant residual carried per run; out of scope = noise/Tier 3
  (inert), Tier-0 drag law / neutral propagation / RNG draw order / mechanism, and the
  R6/p↔κ conditional triggers (document-only). Identifiability of 8+ quantities on one
  observable is the central reported dependency (CALIBRATION_MAP "Anchor coverage").

## Phase A — three open questions resolved (2026-06-30)

A review pass over `TIER2_PHASE_A_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, cross-referenced against
`MASS_DYNAMICS_LOCKED_energy_gated_evaporation.md` and `CALIBRATION_MAP.md`, surfaced
five open questions; three needed a user call and are resolved (decision owner: user).
No code — the `[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]` boundary still holds; docs-only amendment.

- **1. `cooling_relaxed` ladder picture → rule-2 declared-but-unread stub.** The source
  leaves the third electronic-picture first rung **unpinned** (MASS rev-2026-06-21 #3:
  "e.g. a relaxation-weighted blend", *strictly between* mix 74.4 and X₂ 106.9 cm⁻¹;
  CALIBRATION row 20: "one selection, between mix & X₂"). Phase A ships the enum arm
  declared-but-unread, asserts **ordering only** (`statistical_mixture < cooling_relaxed
  < x2_only`), no 4-figure oracle; the concrete blend is pinned at Phase F (removed from
  the rule-2 exception table then). Defer-as-stub is faithful to source, not a shortcut.
- **2. Slice K module renamed `internal_energy_cooling.py` → `solvation_cooling.py`.**
  K2 cools the GAH25 variable **`E_solv.struct = E_bind + E_int`** (MASS lines
  334/837/848); `E_int` is only one additive term *inside* it, owned by Slice U
  (`internal_energy_budget.py`). The module is now named for the variable it relaxes
  (Quality Principle 6). The config knob name `internal_energy_cooling_tau_ps` is the
  sourced MASS §11 name and is **unchanged**. Sibling-doc filename references updated for
  drift (PHASE_C `newton_cool_step` path, PHASE_F Phase-A module list); the historical
  Phase-A-delivered entry above (2026-06-29) predates the rename.
- **3. Full K/U surface built in Phase A.** `newton_cool_step` (K) and
  `reconstruct_e_int_eV` (U) are built and oracle-tested in Phase A even though their
  first *composing* caller is the Phase-C driver (G) — keeps Phase A self-contained.

Two further points flagged for a clarifying comment only (no fork):
- **`E_int^eq = 0` is a split-consistency (tautology) check, not independent
  corroboration** — with `E_int` defined as the residual after subtracting the pair +
  electrostriction split, it is identically 0 at equilibrium by construction (MASS line
  881). Annotated in the Slice K test spec.
- **No default `f_int` lands in Phase A** — only the `f_int_floor` helper is exercised;
  the committed default is a Phase-F calibration output (the floor is scenario-split,
  0.21–0.35 @ 0.80 eV vs 0.065–0.10 @ 2.70 eV, so no single default serves both budgets).

**Cross-reference verdict:** no contradictions with MASS / CALIBRATION_MAP. Knob classes
match (κ + picture **Free** rows 19/20; τ/f_int/f_ret **Bounded** rows 11/13/14;
D₀(1)/D_floor/n\*/|S| **Sourced** rows 18/23/22/12; Σ(21) **Derived** row 21); config field
names match MASS §11; |S|=0.308 / drag-binding 0.1168 confirmed as "separate cross-checks,
not band ends" (row 21).

## Phase A — Slice L DELIVERED (2026-06-30)

Implementation under the `[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]` trigger. TDD throughout
(test→RED→GREEN), oracle asserts against the plan §2/§4 golden values; pure,
stateless, mass-agnostic (no `γ`, no `m`, no RNG, no integrator).

**Build (4 files):**
- `physics/constants.py` — new **sourced** anchors (cm⁻¹, converted via
  `EV_PER_WAVENUMBER`): `N_STAR=21`, `D0_1_X2_WAVENUMBER=106.9`,
  `D0_1_MIX_WAVENUMBER=74.4`, `D0_1_COOLING_RELAXED_WAVENUMBER=90.65`,
  `D_FLOOR_WAVENUMBER=4.97`. Additions, **not** edits to the MD constants table.
- `physics/dissociation_ladder.py` — `sigma`, `d0_of_n`, `ladder_cumsum`,
  `gate_threshold` (alias), `first_rung_d0_eV` resolver, `tabulated_ladder` /
  `TabulatedLadder` fallback, module-level `D_FLOOR_EV` / `CLIFF_CENTER` /
  `_FIRST_RUNG_EV` (the single source of truth for picture keying).
- `config.py` — `LadderForm` / `LadderElectronicPicture` literals; live fields
  `dissociation_ladder` (`form_u`), `ladder_steepness` κ (`1.0`, Free),
  `ladder_electronic_picture` (`statistical_mixture`); `check_ladder_config` guard
  (selector reject + picture reject + `D_0(1) > D_floor`) wired into `validate()`.
- `tests/test_dissociation_ladder.py` (57) + `tests/test_ladder_config.py` (9).

**ExitPlanMode resolutions applied at build (user, 2026-06-30):**
- **(b) `cooling_relaxed` ships a provisional value = arithmetic mean** of mix and
  X₂ (90.65 cm⁻¹ = 0.011240 eV). This **refines** planning-decision #1 above: the
  arm is *not* unread — it returns the provisional blend, which the **ordering**
  oracle (`mix < cooling_relaxed < x2_only`) reads; there is no 4-figure value
  oracle for it, and the concrete relaxation-weighted blend is still pinned at
  Phase F (strict betweenness preserved; faithful to MASS rev-2026-06-21 #3).
- **τ knob name kept** `internal_energy_cooling_tau_ps` (decision #2 / Slice K).
- **`tabulated_ladder` fallback built + round-trip tested** in Phase A (not deferred).
- f_int default → `Optional[float] = None`, config-silent until Phase F — a **Slice
  U** concern, recorded here, not built at L.

**Oracle cross-validation.** First rungs match to 4 figures and are κ-independent
(Form-U normalisation pins `D_0(1)` = source exactly). `Σ(21)` lands in the plan
2-decimal bands (mix 0.17–0.19, X₂ 0.25–0.28 eV) across κ∈[0.3,5] with ~10–11%
spread (the decoupling property); the κ=5 mixture endpoint computes to **0.19306 eV
→ 0.19** and the κ=0.3 X₂ endpoint to **0.24973 → 0.25**, so band membership is
asserted at the plan's stated two-decimal precision (`round(value, 2)`), not an
ad-hoc epsilon — the rounded endpoints *are* the computed values.

**Rule-2 table.** L's three config fields are **born live** (read by the module /
guard on arrival) — nothing to remove from the Tier-0 exception table. The only
Phase-A rule-2 carry is the `cooling_relaxed` *concrete blend* (provisional-average
placeholder until Phase F), tracked in the plan §9 notes.

**Tests:** `test_dissociation_ladder.py` + `test_ladder_config.py` = 66 green; full
suite **1007 passed, 0 failed** (17 warnings = pre-existing `anchored_discrete`
mass-pairing, unrelated).

### Slice L — review + test-hardening pass (2026-06-30)

A high-recall review (8 angles, run inline — small self-authored diff) surfaced
three edge/robustness items; all fixed test-first. No silently-wrong physics in the
sourced κ∈[0.3,5] range was found (the oracles stand).

- **κ positivity guard (was missing).** `d0_of_n` divides by `(1 − σ(1))`; κ ≤ 0
  inverts/flattens the cliff → near-zero denominator → inf rungs (κ = 0 → degenerate
  flat ladder). `check_ladder_config` now refuses `ladder_steepness ≤ 0` (CLAUDE.md
  principle 4). This is also the field's **genuine config-level read** — before the
  guard, `ladder_steepness` was declared-but-unread (module took κ as a param), so
  the "LIVE at Slice L" claim is now actually true.
- **σ overflow → tanh form.** `sigma` reimplemented as the identical
  `0.5·(1 + tanh(x/2))`; saturates instead of forming an `inf` intermediate at sharp
  κ (no `RuntimeWarning`, no oracle change).
- **`ladder_cumsum` fractional-n guard.** Rejects a genuinely fractional occupancy
  loudly (was a cryptic `cum[float]` `IndexError`); integer-valued floats accepted.
- **Test-side fix:** the σ-monotonicity assertion was over-strict (σ saturates
  exactly to 0/1 in the tails → consecutive-equal); corrected to non-decreasing
  globally + strictly-increasing across the unsaturated cliff window.

**Tests after hardening:** Slice-L suites **104 green** (66 → +38); full suite
**1045 passed, 0 failed** (same 17 unrelated warnings). Next: Slice K
(`solvation_cooling.py`).

## Phase A — Slice K DELIVERED (2026-06-30)

Implementation under the `[PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION]` trigger (plan approved in
plan mode). TDD throughout (test→RED→GREEN); pure, stateless, mass-agnostic (no
`γ`, no `m`, no RNG, no integrator). Four open points were resolved by the user
*before* coding (see below).

**Build (4 files):**
- `physics/constants.py` — new **sourced** anchor `S_ABS_EV = 0.308` (eV-primary;
  = 2484 cm⁻¹ total, 118 cm⁻¹/atom @ n*=21; DFT first-shell solvation, MASS K2).
  Addition, **not** an edit to the MD constants table.
- `physics/solvation_cooling.py` — `s_collective_eV` (`|S(N)|=|S|·Σ(N)/Σ(n*)`),
  `e_infinity_eV` (`−|S(N)|`), `e_bind_pair_eV` (`−Σ(N)`, wraps L), `e_electrostriction_eV`
  (`−(|S(N)|−Σ(N))≤0`), `newton_cool_step` (exact `e^{−dt/τ}` relaxation, `dt`-robust,
  fail-loud on `τ≤0`). Consumes L's `ladder_cumsum`.
- `config.py` — fields `solv_struct_asymptote_eV` (`=S_ABS_EV`, single-source) and
  `internal_energy_cooling_tau_ps` (`6.55`, geometric mid of [2.6,16.5]); derived
  `electrostriction_binding_eV` **@property** (`E_elec(n*)` for inspection);
  `check_solvation_cooling_config` guard (`τ>0`, `|S|>0`) wired into `validate()`.
- `tests/test_solvation_cooling.py` + `tests/test_solvation_cooling_config.py`.

**Four open questions resolved (user, 2026-06-30, before coding):**
1. **Config surface = all three fields** (plan §5 literal): `solv_struct_asymptote_eV`,
   `electrostriction_binding_eV` (derived property), `internal_energy_cooling_tau_ps`.
2. **τ default = geometric mid 6.55 ps** (`√(2.6·16.5)`), in the R8 band.
3. **τ guard = `τ>0` only**; the [2.6,16.5] band stays a soft prior, not enforced.
4. **|S| = eV-primary `0.308`**, surfaced as a config field backed by one
   `constants.py` anchor (honors Sourced class, CALIBRATION row 12).

**Plan refinements recorded (as-built vs plan §2/§3/§5):**
- Plan §2.1 listed `S_ABS_eV` as a constant; it ships as a **config field defaulting
  to a single `constants.py` anchor** (the value lives once; field is the override/
  inspection surface). |S| stays **Sourced** — never tuned (the field is not a Free knob).
- Plan §5 filed `solv_struct_asymptote`/`electrostriction_binding` under **L's** bullet,
  but L did not land them — they are **K's** (where consumed). L delivered only its three
  ladder fields. `electrostriction_binding` ships as a **derived @property**, not a stored
  field (it is N-/picture-/κ-dependent).
- **Cold-shed neutrality clarified** to the **pair + `E_int` sub-sum** form
  (`Δ(−Σ + E_int) = +D₀ − D₀ = 0`, machine precision); the collective electrostriction
  marginal (`|S| > Σ(n*)`) is the A8 bath booking, intentionally excluded from the identity.
- **`E_int^eq = 0`** asserted but annotated as a split-consistency **tautology** (MASS
  line 881), not an independent anchor.

**Oracle cross-validation.** `s_collective_eV(n*) = |S| = 0.308 eV` exactly for any
picture/κ (ratio 1); `|S|/n* = 118.3 cm⁻¹` (3 figs); `E_∞(0) = 0` (OQ6); `E_elec ≤ 0`
everywhere; split closes `E_∞ = E_bind_pair + E_elec`; `newton_cool_step` exact decay
factor + fixed point + `dt`-robust; neutrality identity = 0 to 1e-15. Independence test
stubs `ladder_cumsum` (Σ(n)=n) to prove K composes L only through the gate.

**Cross-reference verdict:** no contradictions with MASS / CALIBRATION_MAP. |S| Sourced
(row 12); τ Bounded (row 11), default in-band; the config field name
`internal_energy_cooling_tau_ps` keeps the sourced MASS §11 name even though the module
is `solvation_cooling.py` (the 2026-06-30 rename kept the knob name).

**Rule-2 table.** K's two fields are **born live** (read by the module / guard on
arrival); nothing to remove from the exception table. The only Phase-A rule-2 carry
remains the `cooling_relaxed` *concrete blend* (Slice L; pinned at Phase F).

**Tests:** Slice-K suites **141 green**; full suite **1186 passed, 0 failed** (same 17
unrelated `anchored_discrete` warnings).

### Slice K — review + test-hardening pass (2026-06-30)

An inline review (independent numerical re-verification of every oracle on a fresh
interpreter, plus an 8-angle correctness/edge sweep) confirmed the physics and
surfaced one hardening gap + several coverage gaps; all addressed.

- **Stronger-than-planned result (locked as a regression).** `E_elec ≤ 0` is a
  **structural guarantee for all κ>0**, not just the sourced [0.3,5] band: `Σ(n*) ≤
  n*·D_0(1) = 0.278 eV (X₂) / 0.194 eV (mix)`, both always `< |S| = 0.308`. Verified to
  κ=100 and asserted via `test_sigma_at_nstar_below_S_abs_for_all_kappa` +
  `test_electrostriction_nonpositive_for_all_kappa`.
- **`newton_cool_step` `dt < 0` guard (was missing).** A negative step gives
  `exp(+|dt|/τ) > 1` — silent anti-cooling away from `E_∞`. Now fail-loud (principle 4),
  added test-first (RED→GREEN); `dt = 0` remains a valid no-op. This complements the
  existing `τ > 0` guard.
- **Coverage extended (+36 tests, regression locks on already-correct behavior):**
  picture-correct asymptote targeting, long-time convergence to `E_∞`, array-N/scalar-E
  and dt=0 edges, scalar→float / array→ndarray return discipline on the cooling step,
  `s_abs_eV` override through `e_infinity_eV`, and **fail-loud propagation** of L's
  negative/fractional-N guard through all four consumers + the cooling step.
- **Deliberate non-finding.** The plan §3 "electrostriction ≈4.7× pair-at-radius ~25
  cm⁻¹/atom" parenthetical stays **unencoded** — there is no sourced 25 cm⁻¹ anchor in the
  codebase, so asserting it would test a doc aside, not physics. The encoded electrostriction
  oracles are sign (`≤0`), the split-definition equality, and `|S|/n* = 118 cm⁻¹`.
- **Deliberate non-guard.** Module functions do **not** guard `s_abs_eV > 0` (only the
  config guard does) — the module stays config-agnostic by design (plan §3); `τ`/`dt` are
  guarded because they crash (div-by-zero) or silently invert the cooling, `|S|<0` only
  mis-signs and is caught at config-load.

**Tests after hardening:** Slice-K suites **177 green** (141 → +36); full suite **1222
passed, 0 failed** (same 17 unrelated warnings). Next: Slice U (`internal_energy_budget.py`).
